# Sentiment Analysis with RoBERTa Base Model

This project utilizes the RoBERTa base model for sentiment analysis and includes various optimization techniques to improve efficiency. The sentiment analysis is performed on a collection of texts, and the project consists of several Python scripts for different aspects of the analysis.

## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing task that involves determining the sentiment conveyed in a piece of text. In this project, we leverage the RoBERTa base model, a powerful transformer-based model, for sentiment analysis. Several preprocessing techniques and optimizations are applied to enhance the model's efficiency.

## Dependencies

Make sure to install the following dependencies before running the scripts:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`):
  - transformers
  - nltk
  - pymongo

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
